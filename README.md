# Mr. Green Zombie Survival
Mr. Green's adaptation of JetBoom's popular Garry's Mod Zombie Survival gamemode.

# Goal

Mr. Green's goal is to bring a new era of ZS to its community utilizing ZS 3.0 after the closer of the old ZS 1.0 mod. We will be bringing back much loved gameplay aspects, as well as new gameplay aspects never seen before. By making our project open source, we aim to encourage many different developers to create and push their own content. Thus enhancing the gamemode for years of enjoyment from its playerbase.
